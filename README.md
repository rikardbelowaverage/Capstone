# Capstone
Capstone folder involves the finalization of the Applied Data Science Capstone that is the final exam of Applied Data Science Specialization.
This has involved four different modules : Python for Data Science and AI, Data analysis with Python, and Data visualization with Python.

The final capstone project I will look into how the competition is within the Mexican restaurants in the New York area. First we will get the different neighborhoods in New York.
We will use Forsquare to get the data for what venues that are located in the different areas of New York. We will then get the user reviews, rating and other relevant data to see how the competition is.
